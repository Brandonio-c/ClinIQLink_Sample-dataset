        "question": "What effect does decreased calcium level within acinar cells typically have on trypsin?",
        "answer": "Decreased calcium levels favor trypsin autoactivation.",
        "false_answer": "Decreased calcium levels favor trypsin autoactivation.",
        "incorrect_explanation": "when calcium levels are low, trypsin tends to cleave and inactivate itself; thus, decreased calcium actually inhibits rather than favors trypsin autoactivation. The correct statement would be that high calcium levels favor trypsin autoactivation because they prevent trypsin's ability to cleave and inactivate itself.",

        "false_answer": "Approximately 2% of children with minor head injuries require neurosurgical intervention.",
        "incorrect_explanation": "among children with minor head injuries (MHI), it's estimated that less than 5% have intracranial injury, and less than 1% of those with intracranial injury require neurosurgical intervention. Therefore, the actual rate of children with MHI needing neurosurgical intervention is significantly lower than 2%, closer to less than 1%.",

        "answer": "Hyperopia",
        "false_answer": "Hyperopia",
        "incorrect_explanation": "hyperopia actually refers to a condition resulting from an eye being too short for its focusing power, leading to difficulty seeing nearby objects clearly because images focus behind the retina. The correct term for the condition described by having an eye too long relative to its focusing power is myopia, which causes close objects to be seen clearly but makes distant objects appear blurry since those images focus in front of the retina.",
